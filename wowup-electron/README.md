# Introduction

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 10 and Electron 8 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v10.0.3
- Electron v9.1.0
- Electron Builder v22.7.0

With this sample, you can :

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted.

/!\ Angular 10.x CLI needs Node 10.13 or later to work correctly.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

```bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Included Commands

| Command                  | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run ng:serve:web`   | Execute the app in the browser                                                       |
| `npm run build`          | Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder.                             |
| `npm run build:prod`     | Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder.            |
| `npm run electron:local` | Builds your application and start electron                                           |
| `npm run electron:build` | Builds your application and creates an app consumable based on your operating system |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

YES! You can do it! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies section (not **devDependencies**) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to your final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Quite simple, isn't it ?

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.
**Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case.** Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
